  - Lock/unlock door with a NFC card 
  - Lock/unlock door with a button (indoor side)
  - Manage multiples Cards
  - Edit IDs DataBase 'manually' with an MASTER card, or 'remotely' via a web interface.
  - Make use as simple as we can

To avoid :
  - Expensive costs
  - Security breaks 
  - 

Soft/hard ware required :
  Hardware :
    - Computer (Raspberry Pi &/ Arduino)
    - NFC reader 
    - Servomotor, DC motor w/ coder, Stepper motor
    - Driver/Regulation Card (link between Computer and motors)
    - Obvious, NFC cards
  Software : 
    - Open Softwares
    - Rasp/Arduino Libraries
    - Home-made code 
    (all will be groupped in this Git)
